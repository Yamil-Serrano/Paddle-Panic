# Paddle Panic 

**Paddle Panic** was inspired by a friend who was taking an introduction to programming class. After helping him with a basic Pong game project for his course, I became interested in the concept and decided to create my first version based on the structure of his code. From there, I expanded the idea by adding a CPU-controlled opponen and sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features
- AI-controlled opponent with dynamic movement
- Impact sounds for paddle hits, wall bounces, and scoring
- Score tracking and automatic resets after a point is scored
